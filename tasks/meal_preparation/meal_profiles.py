Meal Preparation Task — Feature generation and meal quality profiles.

Maps execution metrics into the same 5 preference dimensions used by
medication delivery, so both task types feed the same preference learner.

Different meal types produce structurally different feature vectors,
giving the preference learner diverse training signal.
